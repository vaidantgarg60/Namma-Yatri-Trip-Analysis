üöï Namma Yatri Trip Analysis Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)
This project presents an interactive data analysis dashboard built using SQL and Power BI to explore ride data from Namma Yatri, a Bengaluru-based mobility platform. The goal was to uncover insights into trip volume, customer engagement, and driver performance across different assemblies. Using SQL, raw data was cleaned, transformed, and used to compute KPIs such as total trips, earnings, and conversion rates. Power BI was utilized to visualize these metrics through dynamic charts, trend lines, and maps. The dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions by highlighting high-demand zones, fare trends, and ride patterns across the city.
